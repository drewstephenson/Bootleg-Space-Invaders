# Bootleg-Space-Invaders
Repository for a Space Invaders type game made in Python. Originally from the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes, and I have made some of my own additions over time.

The game begins with a play button, once you press it the game will start.

The goal of the game is to prevent the aliens from reaching the bottom of the screen or colliding with the ship for as long as you can. Use the arrow keys to move left and right and space to shoot. Once you run out of lives, the game ends. You can also press Q to end the game at any time.

Your highest score will be saved to a JSON file and displayed the next time you play. To help you get a high score, powerups also have a 1% chance of dropping from any alien. These are randomly chosen between an extra life, triple shot, piercing shot, or a powerup that completely clears the level.

The longer you go, the faster the game becomes. Try to beat your high score!
